A simple game with easy rules, written purely in python.

GUI and CLI versions available.

## About the Game ##

**HangMan is an interactive real world game. The game chooses an entirely random word,and the user tries to guess it by suggesting letters untill the hangman figure is completed.**

## Modules used-
- `pygame`
- `rich`

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the modules automatically.

## Running the game
Currently the program is not packaged into exe or any other format, so you have to run the python file directly.

New contributers can implement packaging the game into an executable.

### For Linux
- Install requisite modules(see modules section).
- Navigate to either GUI/CLI folder and run `python3 hangman.py`

### For Windows
_Dude use Linux_ :wink:
- Just replace python3 with python in the above steps.

___RULES___

1. Number of Dashes represent the length of the word.
2. At each correct guess the letter is placed at its original position in the word.
3. User loses if the HangMan is completed.
