___RULES___

1. Number of Dashes represent the length of the word.
2. At each correct guess the letter is placed at its original position in the word.
3. User loses if the HangMan is completed.


## Modules used-
- `pygame`
- `rich`

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the modules automatically.

## Running the game
~~Currently the program is not packaged into exe or any other format, so you have to run the python file directly.~~<br>
~~New contributers can implement packaging the game into an executable.~~

Recent Releases contain executable file for Linux.

### For Linux
- Run the executable.

  - You can download the latest executable file from [releases](https://github.com/anantdark/hangman/releases)
  - Make the file executable
    ```
    sudo chmod +x filename
    ```
  - Run the file `./filename`
  
  -------------
- Run with python interpreter.
  - Install requisite modules(see modules section).
  - Navigate to either GUI/CLI folder and run `python3 hangman.py`

### For Window
_Dude use Linux_ :wink:
- There is no exe file for windows users. ü§ê: (PRs Welcome)
- Just replace python3 with python in the above steps.
